== Introduction

{gr8crm} is a set of http://www.grails.org/[Grails Web Application Framework]
plugins that makes it easy to develop web applications with CRM functionality.

You can find more information about {gr8crm} on the main documentation site {homepage}.

=== Customer Relationship Management

Customer relationship management (CRM) is a system for managing a company’s interactions with current and future customers.
It involves using technology to organize, automate and synchronize sales, marketing, customer service, and technical support.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management[Wikipedia]

The {gr8crm} "Ecosystem" currently contains over 40 Grails plugins. For a complete list of plugins see {homepage}.

Each {gr8crm} plugin defines a http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html[Bounded Context]
that focus on one specific domain, for example *contact*, *project* or *document*.

== Content Management UI Plugin

This plugin provide a Twitter Bootstrap user interface for authoring content in {gr8crm} applications.

== Groovy Server Pages

This section describes some useful Groovy Server Pages (GSP) included in this plugin, pages used for Content Management.

=== Attach documents to domain instances

+crmContent/_embedded.gsp+

If you have a page that shows information in tabs you can add an extra tab that display attachments.
In this tab you can also let users upload files and even create new files attached to a domain instance.

The tab looks like this:

As you can see the *Files (5)* tab displays existing attachments and also has buttons for creating and uploading new content.

To insert the extra tab in a .gsp page without modifying the .gsp source you include the following code in +BootStrap.groovy+.

[source,groovy]
.BootStrap.groovy
----
class BootStrap {

    def crmCoreService
    def crmPluginService
    def crmContentService

    def init = { servletContext ->

        crmPluginService.registerView('crmContact', 'show', 'tabs',   // <1>
            [id: "documents",
                index: 500,     // <2>
                label: "crmContact.tab.documents.label",
                template: '/crmContent/embedded',
                plugin: "crm-content-ui",
                model: {
                    def id = crmCoreService.getReferenceIdentifier(crmContact)  // <3>
                    def result = crmContentService.findResourcesByReference(crmContact) // <4>
                    return [bean: crmContact, list: result, totalCount: result.size(),
                            reference: id, openAction: 'show']
                } // <5>
            ]
        )
    }
}
----
<1> Add the tab to crmContact/show.gsp
<2> Tab order, lower number tabs are inserted to the left of higher number tabs.
<3> The reference identifier is used to create a *dynamic relation* between the attachment and the domain instance.
<4> Find existing files attached to the domain instance so the inserted view/tab can list them.
<5> The +model+ Closure have access to page scope in crmContact/show.gsp and can therefore reference the domain instance *crmContact*.

=== Working with folders and files

+crmFolder/list.gsp+

Included in this plugin is a simple File Manager. The +list+ action in +CrmFolderController+ displays folders and files.
Users can create new folders and upload files. It is also possible to create new TEXT and HTML files using an embedded Rich Text editor.

=== Create a new HTML file

+crmContent/create.gsp+

The +create+ action in +CrmContentController+ displays an embedded Rich Text editor (ckEditor) that lets the user create
a new HTML document.

image::crm-html-editor.png[Rich Text Editor, role="thumb"]

The +create+ action takes a parameter +ref+ that should contain a *Reference Identifier* to the domain instance
that the new content should be attached to.
For example +crmContent/create?ref=crmResourceFolder@42+ would attach the newly created file to a folder with id 42.
